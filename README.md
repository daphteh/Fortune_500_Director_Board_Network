# Value of social networks
Social network scholars think of social connections as ['pipes and prisms'](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/323038). Social networks **aka pipes** enable people & organizations to access resources & information which influence their opportunities or [limitations](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640283) and thus their behavior. Social connections **aka prisms** also affect how they perceive the world & vice versa. We can use social networks as a sytematic way to measure constructs like status which can affect an organization's [exchange partners](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393299#metadata_info_tab_contents). 

## The Data
This repo uses data on corporate board intelocks from 1998 to 2018. A board interlock occurs when a director sits on 2 or more boards. Thus, forming a connection (aka interlock) between them. Board interlocks are important because they affect the practices that companies [adopt](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/231170). 

The data comes from Boardex and comprises of:
- 1,153 companies
- 1,5367 individuals
